/// The Entity
/// Entities encapsulate Enterprise wide business rules.
/// An entity can be an object with methods, or it can be a set of data structures and functions.
///
/// The Interactor
/// Interactors abstract rich business logic. They are the boundry between Presentation and Business (Domain) Logic
///
/// The Use Case
/// Use Cases have no knowledge of anything other than the business rules and Domain Entities which they're responsible for.
/// They can manipulate entities, however all communication with the outside world go through Gateways.
/// Use Cases are concreate implementations of Interactors and contain business logic.
