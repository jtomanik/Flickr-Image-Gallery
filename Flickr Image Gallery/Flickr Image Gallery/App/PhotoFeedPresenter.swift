/// This Presenter is responsible for driving PhotoFeed screen.
/// It is a common ground between "Presenter" and "ViewModel" from two sister architectures MVP and MVVM,
/// It has following characteristics:
/// * Presenter is owned by the View
/// * Presenter contains all presentation logic
/// * View delegates user interactions to the Presenter
/// * Presenter contains the logic to handle user interactions
/// * Presenter provides reactive data binding mechanism to the View to update it's appearance automatically
/// * View's appearance is controlled through DisplayModels that encapsulate all data to be presented
/// * Presenter has no references to the View
/// * Presenter has all it's dependencies injected
/// * Presenter has no dependencies to UIKit
/// * Presenter can be easily tested
